For tis project I'll use a TeleBot library (https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI)

today is 07 Jan 2021 and my ToDo list is:

- create an utility for loading data from the local storage (API key, messages templates etc.)
- implement a message class

Project files structure:

- bot.py - main module
- bot_loading_utils.py - set of the methods to help load a bot API and messages templates for bot

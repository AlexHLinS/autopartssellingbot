# autopartssellingbot

Intro:
This is a Telegram bot for my friend, it has to be help him to sell auto spare parts.

Start to develop it at the summer of 2020, but had lack of motivation and knowledge )

For tis project I'll use a TeleBot library (https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI)

today is 07 Jan 2021 and my ToDo list is:

- create an utility for loading data from the local storage (API key, messages templates etc.)
- implement a message class

Project files structure:

- bot.py - main module
- bot_loading_utils.py - set of the methods to help load a bot API and messages templates for bot
